YouTubeVideoDownloader V1.0.0 by Kevin Flynn (xars7)

This is a super simple program that is designed to 
download videos from YouTube and store them in a folder
on your Desktop named "YouTubeVideoDownloader"

***WINDOWS USERS***
If you cannot find the folder on your desktop after downloading
a video. Go to your file explorer and copy "YouTubeVideoDownloader" into the search 
without quotes. The folder has been created it just hasn't registered
on your Desktop it's a weird bug that I'm currently trying to fix.



In order to run this script in your own python interperter you need to have the following
things

1. pip
2. pytube

That's it, and they are both super easy to install. Here are links to some resources
you can read to help you install pip and pytube. Trust me if I can do it you can do it :)

How to install pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

How to install pytube: https://pytube.io/en/latest/user/install.html#install

Feel free to use the source code and manipulate it to your liking and for your own use!

Peace,
