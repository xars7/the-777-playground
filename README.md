# the-777-playground

This is not a single project this is a code playground for my personal projects, feel free to look around. 

As of currently there is only a few projects right now but I will be updating it soon while I work on my projects for 2022!

YouTubeVideoDownloader - A simple script that downloads whatever YouTube video url you give it

PasswordSafe - A program to generate passwords and keep them safe!

WikiSpider - this simple web crawler will go onto the wikipage you specify in the startingURL variable. 
            it then will go on an endless loop of choosing random links on that wiki page until it either gets stuck
            or can't request the page. Watch the spider go from the topic 'web scraping' to 'Kanpur Central railway station'

TerminalTimer - very simple program with a Countdown timer and StopWatch function

Updater - this is a bash script used to update and upgrade your linux without having to type in the command

Dog_Hasher - quite the opposite of Hashcat. Want to learn how to use hashcat but want to do it legally? use this program to make a random hash
            from the rockyou.txt wordlist. 

encoder64 - this is a simple script that will encode and decode text using base64
