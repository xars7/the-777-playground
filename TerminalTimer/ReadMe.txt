 TerminalTimer v1.0.0 by KevinFlynn/xars7

   Description -
       This is a program that I originally found on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-countdown-timer-using-python/
       that I modified for my own liking. I like to segment my work time into 30 minute blocks so I often find myself using 
       https://www.online-stopwatch.com/ which granted is an awesome and much better put together program than mine, but I wanted
       to make my own so here it is. 
   
       I would like to eventually make this program take an input with minutes and seconds as apposed to having to input the time by seconds
 
       The only way to currently exit out of the stop watch and countdown is by hitting CTRL+C so keep that in mind. I would like to fix this 
       in the future.
