PasswordSafe v1.0.0 by Kevin Flynn (xars7)

This program will randomly generate passwords for you and store them for you.

In order to get started you have to create a master login with a master username and password. This will create a master encryption key that is used to encrypt
your passwords that you make.

After you create a password the credentials are encrypted and stored in the PasswordDB and UsernameDB as a .txt file

Don't bother looking in these files for your username passwords because they are encrypted. This is to help keep from prying eyes.

To view your passwords login to your master account and select the view password option

On the creation of your password you are asked to type a name that is associated to the login credentials (ex. GMail)

after selecting the view password option type the name that you gave in the password creation and hit enter. the program will then find and display your credentials in this format

username | password

I hope you enjoy this program as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Feel free to take the source code and manipulate it to your needs and liking!

Peace,
