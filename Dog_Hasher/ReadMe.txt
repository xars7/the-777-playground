# Dog_Hasher.py v1.0.0 by Kevin Flynn/xars7
# 1-8-22
#
# Description - 
#   This program is the opposite of hashcat. It will take a password from the rockyou.txt dictionary file, hash it using the algorithm you choose and (md5, sha1, sha224, etc), and 
#   give you the hash to crack. Good luck and have fun cracking!
#
# In order to use this program you need to move your rockyou.txt wordlist into the project folder and name it "rockyou.txt". That is the only way this program will be able to find it
# Other than that the only thing you need to run this program is Python 3 
# Peace,
